1
00:00:55,223 --> 00:00:59,227
Once in a while when I wake up

2
00:01:00,186 --> 00:01:03,064
I find myself crying.

3
00:01:03,773 --> 00:01:05,774
The dream I must have had

4
00:01:05,775 --> 00:01:07,443
I can never recall.

5
00:01:08,027 --> 00:01:09,112
But...

6
00:01:09,654 --> 00:01:10,821
But...

7
00:01:10,822 --> 00:01:14,074
the sensation that I've lost something

8
00:01:14,075 --> 00:01:17,203
lingers for a long time after I wake up.

9
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:26,921
I'm always searching

10
00:01:27,672 --> 00:01:30,008
for something, for someone.

11
00:01:30,592 --> 00:01:33,427
This feeling has possessed me

12
00:01:33,428 --> 00:01:35,263
I think from that day...

13
00:01:36,598 --> 00:01:39,684
That day when the stars came falling.

14
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:41,893
It was almost as if...

15
00:01:41,894 --> 00:01:44,647
as if a scene from a dream.

16
00:01:45,148 --> 00:01:46,691
Nothing more, nothing less

17
00:01:48,151 --> 00:01:50,194
than a beautiful view.

18
00:01:50,778 --> 00:01:55,033
Ah, if only our voices speak at night

19
00:01:56,451 --> 00:02:01,872
could ever reach the very edge
of this world, and the time

20
00:02:01,873 --> 00:02:06,294
Instead of fading into air and dust

21
00:02:06,669 --> 00:02:09,755
Then what will the words could ever be?

22
00:02:09,756 --> 00:02:12,549
Farthest words from 'probably'

23
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:19,432
Let's make a promise, that will never fade.
Let's say it together in count of three, oh

24
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:32,944
Ah, I'm told that some part of
every wish will be heard

25
00:02:32,945 --> 00:02:35,614
But lately I lost sight
of the truth in those words

26
00:02:35,615 --> 00:02:40,410
I can't even remember when I gave up
believing. What could have been the reason?

27
00:02:40,411 --> 00:02:43,747
Ah, the very moment that the rain will stop

28
00:02:43,748 --> 00:02:46,416
And the place rainbow born and dies

29
00:02:46,417 --> 00:02:48,335
And where the end of this life lies

30
00:02:48,336 --> 00:02:51,923
I've always been insisting there was
something that I've longing for

31
00:02:56,594 --> 00:02:57,928
One day we'll reach to

32
00:02:57,929 --> 00:03:01,682
emotions unexplored unprecedented

33
00:03:01,683 --> 00:03:04,643
We'll high-five love we've yet to discover

34
00:03:04,644 --> 00:03:06,770
and give a kiss to time

35
00:03:06,771 --> 00:03:12,193
The five dimensions keep on teasing me.
But I will keep on looking at you, dear

36
00:03:12,402 --> 00:03:15,822
Let's make a sign for
when we say nice to meet you again

37
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:21,285
I'm on my way to you,
chasing after your name

38
00:03:47,729 --> 00:03:51,607
Taki. Taki.

39
00:03:52,608 --> 00:03:54,569
Don't you remember me?

40
00:03:56,821 --> 00:03:58,281
My name is...

41
00:04:00,032 --> 00:04:01,242
Mitsuha!

42
00:04:37,236 --> 00:04:39,322
Mitsuha, what are you doing?

43
00:04:39,489 --> 00:04:42,909
Well, it feels incredibly realistic...

44
00:04:43,993 --> 00:04:46,036
What? "Mitsuha"?

45
00:04:46,037 --> 00:04:49,081
Are you half asleep? Breakfast!

46
00:04:49,373 --> 00:04:50,166
Hurry up!

47
00:05:10,394 --> 00:05:14,524
What? What?

48
00:05:21,906 --> 00:05:24,407
Do you want last night's leftovers?

49
00:05:24,408 --> 00:05:26,284
You can have it.

50
00:05:26,285 --> 00:05:28,119
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

51
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,913
Mitsuha, you're late!

52
00:05:29,914 --> 00:05:31,999
I'll make breakfast tomorrow.

53
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:39,256
Is this too much?

54
00:05:39,257 --> 00:05:40,341
Well. It's okay

55
00:05:40,925 --> 00:05:42,510
You're normal today.

56
00:05:43,094 --> 00:05:45,095
You were nuts yesterday.

57
00:05:45,096 --> 00:05:47,056
What are you talking about?

58
00:05:49,058 --> 00:05:52,687
Good morning, everyone.

59
00:05:53,145 --> 00:05:57,441
This is an announcement
from Itomori Town Hall.

60
00:05:57,984 --> 00:06:01,027
Regarding the mayoral election

61
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:04,406
on the 20th next month,

62
00:06:04,407 --> 00:06:05,449
the election committee...

63
00:06:08,536 --> 00:06:09,412
"Comet to pass by in a month:
Visible to the naked eye"

64
00:06:09,495 --> 00:06:11,873
A comet with an orbital period of

65
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:14,542
1,200 years will pass by in a month.

66
00:06:14,876 --> 00:06:16,793
The comet will be visible

67
00:06:16,794 --> 00:06:19,170
to the naked eye for several days...

68
00:06:19,171 --> 00:06:21,214
It's time for you to make up with him.

69
00:06:21,215 --> 00:06:22,258
It's an adult matter.

70
00:06:22,341 --> 00:06:23,175
"Position of Cornet Tiamat"

71
00:06:23,342 --> 00:06:24,759
JAXA are preparing to observe

72
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,970
the celestial show of the century.

73
00:06:26,053 --> 00:06:26,846
"Closest on October 4th"

74
00:06:43,487 --> 00:06:45,031
We're going!

75
00:07:05,468 --> 00:07:07,720
Study hard!

76
00:07:12,808 --> 00:07:14,267
Mitsuha!

77
00:07:14,268 --> 00:07:16,311
Morning, Sayaka, Tessie.

78
00:07:16,312 --> 00:07:17,271
Morning.

79
00:07:17,272 --> 00:07:20,148
- Get off.
- Why? Meanie.

80
00:07:20,149 --> 00:07:22,025
- You're heavy.
- That's rude.

81
00:07:22,026 --> 00:07:24,277
You two get along so well.

82
00:07:24,278 --> 00:07:25,529
We do not!

83
00:07:28,157 --> 00:07:30,659
Your hair looks all right today.

84
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:31,826
What?

85
00:07:31,827 --> 00:07:32,745
Yeah,

86
00:07:32,746 --> 00:07:35,498
- did your grandma exorcise you?
- Exorcise?

87
00:07:35,665 --> 00:07:37,791
You were totally possessed yesterday!

88
00:07:37,792 --> 00:07:40,335
Cut out the occultism.

89
00:07:40,336 --> 00:07:43,171
Mitsuha is just stressed. Right?

90
00:07:43,172 --> 00:07:45,840
Huh? What are you talking about?

91
00:07:45,841 --> 00:07:47,176
You don't remember?

92
00:07:48,636 --> 00:07:50,428
And above all,

93
00:07:50,429 --> 00:07:52,890
restoring the town's fiscal health

94
00:07:53,182 --> 00:07:56,267
to continue its revitalization project!

95
00:07:56,268 --> 00:07:58,186
Only when these are achieved

96
00:07:58,187 --> 00:08:01,732
can a safe and secure community be created!

97
00:08:02,108 --> 00:08:03,693
As the incumbent mayor...

98
00:08:04,402 --> 00:08:07,195
He'll be reelected again anyway.

99
00:08:07,196 --> 00:08:10,240
I heard he's been dishing out the pork.

100
00:08:10,241 --> 00:08:11,783
Hey, Miyamizu.

101
00:08:11,784 --> 00:08:13,160
Morning.

102
00:08:13,744 --> 00:08:15,286
The mayor's kid and

103
00:08:15,287 --> 00:08:17,080
his contractor's kid get along too.

104
00:08:17,081 --> 00:08:18,165
Ew.

105
00:08:22,753 --> 00:08:24,171
Mitsuha!

106
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:26,716
Stand up straight!

107
00:08:27,842 --> 00:08:29,509
He's strict with his family.

108
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:31,052
I'm impressed.

109
00:08:31,053 --> 00:08:32,178
So embarrassing.

110
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:33,431
Pathetic!

111
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:35,391
Mitsuha.

112
00:08:36,684 --> 00:08:38,936
In front of everybody...

113
00:08:42,148 --> 00:08:43,315
"Who are you?"

114
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:52,365
"Tasokare" (Twilight)

115
00:08:52,366 --> 00:08:56,244
"Tasokare" means "Who is that" and is

116
00:08:56,245 --> 00:08:58,788
the origin of the word "tasogare-doki."

117
00:08:58,789 --> 00:09:02,500
Twilight, when it's neither day nor night.

118
00:09:02,501 --> 00:09:04,544
When the world blurs and one might

119
00:09:04,545 --> 00:09:07,965
encounter something not human.

120
00:09:08,466 --> 00:09:11,969
Older expressions include "karetaso-doki"

121
00:09:13,054 --> 00:09:15,473
and "kawatare-doki."

122
00:09:15,973 --> 00:09:18,433
I have a question! Not "kataware-doki"?

123
00:09:18,434 --> 00:09:22,188
"Kataware-doki"? I think
that's a local dialect.

124
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,772
I've heard that Itomori's elderly

125
00:09:23,773 --> 00:09:24,815
still use classical language.

126
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:26,067
"Who are you?"

127
00:09:26,192 --> 00:09:27,818
We're in the boonies, after all.

128
00:09:30,571 --> 00:09:32,739
OK next, Mitsuha.

129
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:33,991
Yes.

130
00:09:34,992 --> 00:09:37,953
Oh, so you remember your name today.

131
00:09:40,706 --> 00:09:42,208
You don't remember?

132
00:09:44,168 --> 00:09:46,252
Yesterday you forgot

133
00:09:46,253 --> 00:09:48,297
where your desk and locker were.

134
00:09:48,547 --> 00:09:51,592
Your hair is messy with no ribbon.

135
00:09:54,136 --> 00:09:56,596
What? No way! Really?

136
00:09:56,597 --> 00:09:59,099
It was like you had amnesia.

137
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,308
Well,

138
00:10:00,309 --> 00:10:03,687
I do feel like I've been
in a strange dream lately...

139
00:10:03,896 --> 00:10:06,607
A dream about someone else's life?

140
00:10:07,149 --> 00:10:09,902
I can't remember clearly.

141
00:10:10,277 --> 00:10:12,446
I know! That was...

142
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:14,030
your previous life!

143
00:10:14,031 --> 00:10:14,865
Or maybe

144
00:10:14,866 --> 00:10:18,077
your subconscious
linked to the Everett multiverse...

145
00:10:18,327 --> 00:10:19,452
Stay out of this.

146
00:10:19,453 --> 00:10:22,957
Oh! Tessie, did you write
that in my notebook?

147
00:10:24,792 --> 00:10:26,043
Nothing.

148
00:10:27,253 --> 00:10:31,047
But Mitsuha,
you really were a bit weird yesterday.

149
00:10:31,048 --> 00:10:32,967
Are you feeling alright?

150
00:10:34,176 --> 00:10:37,512
That's so strange. I feel fine.

151
00:10:37,513 --> 00:10:39,013
Maybe you are stressful.

152
00:10:39,014 --> 00:10:41,516
That ritual is coming up, isn't it?

153
00:10:41,517 --> 00:10:44,018
Oh, don't remind me!

154
00:10:44,019 --> 00:10:46,564
I can't stand this town anymore.

155
00:10:47,148 --> 00:10:49,482
It's too small and packed.

156
00:10:49,483 --> 00:10:52,819
I want to graduate and go to Tokyo.

157
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:57,783
I don't blame you.
There's really nothing in here.

158
00:10:59,285 --> 00:11:01,536
Trains come every 2 hours.

159
00:11:01,537 --> 00:11:03,580
The store closes at 9 p.m.

160
00:11:03,581 --> 00:11:05,540
No bookstore. No dentist.

161
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:06,292
"Pub Mother" "Pub Cat's Eye"

162
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:08,127
But have 2 pubs for some reason.

163
00:11:08,294 --> 00:11:09,170
No jobs.

164
00:11:09,171 --> 00:11:10,378
No brides.

165
00:11:10,379 --> 00:11:12,715
Short sunlight hours.

166
00:11:14,466 --> 00:11:16,760
- Give me a break!
- What?

167
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:20,513
I mean... How about we stop by a cafe?

168
00:11:20,514 --> 00:11:22,182
- A cafe?
- Really?

169
00:11:22,183 --> 00:11:23,434
Where?

170
00:11:27,563 --> 00:11:30,482
Hello.

171
00:11:35,196 --> 00:11:36,821
This is a cafe?

172
00:11:36,822 --> 00:11:38,657
You knew there wasn't one.

173
00:11:39,033 --> 00:11:41,493
Mitsuha just went home.

174
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:45,079
Things must be rough for her.

175
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,582
Because she is the center stage.

176
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,876
Yeah.

177
00:11:51,795 --> 00:11:53,421
Hey, Tessie.

178
00:11:53,422 --> 00:11:54,381
What?

179
00:11:55,132 --> 00:11:57,551
What will you do after you graduate?

180
00:11:58,052 --> 00:11:59,594
What's this?

181
00:11:59,595 --> 00:12:00,971
Are you asking about my future?

182
00:12:02,598 --> 00:12:03,932
Nothing special.

183
00:12:03,933 --> 00:12:07,686
I'll probably keep on
living a normal life in this town.

184
00:12:23,786 --> 00:12:25,913
I'd rather do that too.

185
00:12:26,163 --> 00:12:28,873
You're not ready yet, Yotsuha.

186
00:12:28,874 --> 00:12:31,001
Listen to the thread's voice.

187
00:12:31,293 --> 00:12:34,504
When you keep twining like that,

188
00:12:34,505 --> 00:12:36,506
emotions will eventually start flowing

189
00:12:36,507 --> 00:12:38,300
between you and the thread.

190
00:12:38,884 --> 00:12:40,510
Threads don't talk.

191
00:12:40,511 --> 00:12:42,637
She means, "Focus."

192
00:12:42,638 --> 00:12:44,932
1,000 years of Itomori's history is etched

193
00:12:45,349 --> 00:12:48,601
into our braided cords.

194
00:12:48,602 --> 00:12:52,563
Listen. 200 years ago...

195
00:12:52,564 --> 00:12:54,148
Here she goes again.

196
00:12:54,149 --> 00:12:57,360
Sandal maker Mayugoro's bathroom caught

197
00:12:57,361 --> 00:13:01,281
on fire and burned down
the whole area around.

198
00:13:01,282 --> 00:13:04,326
The shrine and old documents were destroyed

199
00:13:04,743 --> 00:13:06,202
and this is known as...

200
00:13:06,203 --> 00:13:07,955
The Great Fire of Mayugoro.

201
00:13:08,289 --> 00:13:12,584
The fire has his name? Poor Mayugoro.

202
00:13:13,002 --> 00:13:16,546
So the meaning of our festivals became

203
00:13:16,547 --> 00:13:19,049
unknown and only the formality lived on.

204
00:13:19,883 --> 00:13:21,884
But even if words are lost,

205
00:13:21,885 --> 00:13:23,720
tradition should be handed down.

206
00:13:23,721 --> 00:13:28,309
That's our responsbility
at Miyamizu Shrine.

207
00:13:30,978 --> 00:13:34,940
But that foolish son-in-law...

208
00:13:36,025 --> 00:13:40,112
He not only left Shinto
priesthood but also.

209
00:13:40,446 --> 00:13:43,323
Play politics? He's hopeless.

210
00:13:43,324 --> 00:13:45,743
Have one more, my man.

211
00:13:48,704 --> 00:13:50,997
I'm counting on your help again.

212
00:13:50,998 --> 00:13:52,707
Leave it to me.

213
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:56,336
You'll get votes from the Kadoiri
and Sakagami Districts.

214
00:13:56,337 --> 00:13:57,795
How's it going with her?

215
00:13:57,796 --> 00:13:59,548
It's not that easy.

216
00:14:01,425 --> 00:14:03,552
I smell corruption.

217
00:14:03,635 --> 00:14:05,137
Don't be ridiculous.

218
00:14:05,763 --> 00:14:08,139
Bring us a few more hot sake.

219
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:09,390
OK.

220
00:14:09,391 --> 00:14:12,060
Katsuhiko, come help on site this weekend.

221
00:14:12,061 --> 00:14:14,187
Learn how to use explosives.

222
00:14:14,188 --> 00:14:15,438
Yes.

223
00:14:15,439 --> 00:14:16,606
Can't hear you.

224
00:14:16,607 --> 00:14:17,566
Yes!

225
00:14:30,954 --> 00:14:33,957
We both have had enough, don't we?

226
00:14:52,142 --> 00:14:55,144
Is that Yotsuha? She's all grown up.

227
00:14:55,145 --> 00:14:57,815
They're both pretty like their mother.

228
00:14:59,608 --> 00:15:00,692
Hey.

229
00:15:00,943 --> 00:15:02,319
Hey.

230
00:15:34,226 --> 00:15:36,770
It's the oldest sake in the world.

231
00:15:37,354 --> 00:15:39,981
By chewing on rice, spitting it out,

232
00:15:39,982 --> 00:15:42,775
and letting it ferment, it becomes alcohol.

233
00:15:42,776 --> 00:15:44,361
"Kuchikamisake."

234
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:47,864
Do the gods appreciate sake made that way?

235
00:15:47,865 --> 00:15:49,533
Of course they do.

236
00:15:51,618 --> 00:15:54,037
Hey, look. It's Miyamizu.

237
00:15:59,668 --> 00:16:02,003
Oh! I could never do that!

238
00:16:02,004 --> 00:16:03,671
Isn't she embarrassed?

239
00:16:03,672 --> 00:16:05,382
I can't believe it.

240
00:16:19,646 --> 00:16:22,065
Cheer up, Mitsuha.

241
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,901
Who cares if a few classmates saw you?

242
00:16:24,902 --> 00:16:27,821
I envy your "pre-pubescent"
carefree attitude.

243
00:16:28,197 --> 00:16:31,449
Why not sell lots of kuchikamisake and

244
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:33,075
use the money to go to Tokyo?

245
00:16:33,076 --> 00:16:35,620
Where do you get such ideas?

246
00:16:35,621 --> 00:16:38,456
Sell them with photos and making videos.

247
00:16:38,457 --> 00:16:41,375
Name it "Shrine Maiden's Sake."

248
00:16:41,376 --> 00:16:42,961
You'll make money!

249
00:16:43,962 --> 00:16:45,672
"Shrine Maiden's Sake"

250
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:48,926
No. That breaks the Liquor Tax Law.

251
00:16:50,552 --> 00:16:52,429
That's the problem?

252
00:16:58,268 --> 00:17:03,231
I hate this town! I hate this life!

253
00:17:03,232 --> 00:17:07,778
Please make me a handsome Tokyo boy
in my next life!

254
00:17:11,782 --> 00:17:13,659
What a fool...

255
00:17:41,603 --> 00:17:42,563
Ow!

256
00:17:45,357 --> 00:17:47,401
Ouch...

257
00:17:55,993 --> 00:17:57,160
Where...

258
00:18:08,547 --> 00:18:11,341
Something's there...

259
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:25,855
Ow!

260
00:18:25,856 --> 00:18:27,649
Taki, Are you up?

261
00:18:29,901 --> 00:18:32,111
It was your turn to cook.

262
00:18:32,112 --> 00:18:33,279
Wake up on time.

263
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,823
I'm sorry.

264
00:18:36,074 --> 00:18:39,369
I'm going now. Drink all the miso soup.

265
00:18:39,745 --> 00:18:40,579
OK.

266
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:43,372
Go to school even if you're late.

267
00:18:43,373 --> 00:18:44,499
See you.

268
00:18:45,626 --> 00:18:46,960
Have a nice day.

269
00:18:58,305 --> 00:18:59,765
What a strange dream.

270
00:19:01,391 --> 00:19:03,769
"From Tsukasa: Run, you're late!"

271
00:19:05,228 --> 00:19:09,733
What? Who's it from? Tsukasa? Who's that?

272
00:19:19,409 --> 00:19:21,203
I have to use the bathroom.

273
00:19:30,087 --> 00:19:31,797
This is too realistic.

274
00:20:22,222 --> 00:20:23,265
"Shinjuku Station"

275
00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:45,036
I'm in Tokyo.

276
00:20:49,499 --> 00:20:50,667
"Jingu High School"

277
00:20:52,002 --> 00:20:53,961
- Where'd you get it?
- Daikanyama.

278
00:20:53,962 --> 00:20:55,880
The front act at the next gig...

279
00:20:55,881 --> 00:20:58,800
Let's skip club and go to a movie.

280
00:21:03,638 --> 00:21:05,098
Taki!

281
00:21:06,433 --> 00:21:10,270
Arriving at noon, huh? Let's eat lunch.

282
00:21:10,687 --> 00:21:12,229
You ignored my message

283
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:14,106
Oh, Tsukasa?

284
00:21:14,107 --> 00:21:16,902
At least you sound apologetic.

285
00:21:18,737 --> 00:21:20,154
You got lost?

286
00:21:20,155 --> 00:21:21,155
Yeah.

287
00:21:21,156 --> 00:21:24,825
How could you get lost
on the way to school?

288
00:21:24,826 --> 00:21:28,496
- Uh... Well... I (watashi)...
- Feminine?

289
00:21:28,497 --> 00:21:29,998
I (watakushi)!

290
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:31,666
I (boku)?

291
00:21:32,292 --> 00:21:33,335
I (ore)?

292
00:21:35,504 --> 00:21:37,630
I was enjoying myself.

293
00:21:37,631 --> 00:21:41,301
It's so festive to me all in Tokyo.

294
00:21:41,676 --> 00:21:43,678
You seem to have a dialect.

295
00:21:44,179 --> 00:21:45,388
Where's your lunch?

296
00:21:46,097 --> 00:21:48,808
- Geez.
- Are you half asleep?

297
00:21:48,809 --> 00:21:49,934
You got something?

298
00:21:49,935 --> 00:21:51,978
Croquette-egg sandwich sounds good!

299
00:21:56,233 --> 00:21:57,400
Thank you.

300
00:21:59,653 --> 00:22:01,153
Let's go to a cafe.

301
00:22:01,154 --> 00:22:03,490
Oh that one? OK. Corning, Taki?

302
00:22:03,865 --> 00:22:06,909
What? What? What?

303
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:07,911
A cafe?

304
00:22:11,623 --> 00:22:13,290
Nice timberwork up there.

305
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:15,252
Yeah, they attented to details.

306
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:17,254
Taki, have you decided?

307
00:22:18,463 --> 00:22:21,549
What? I could live for a month

308
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:22,926
for the price of this!

309
00:22:23,093 --> 00:22:25,678
What age are you from again?

310
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:29,474
Hmm. Oh well. It's a dream anyway.

311
00:22:36,064 --> 00:22:37,315
What a great dream.

312
00:22:43,321 --> 00:22:46,575
Oh no, what should I do? I'm late for work!

313
00:22:47,033 --> 00:22:48,493
Your shift is today?

314
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:50,829
- Go, then.
- Oh, yeah.

315
00:22:52,205 --> 00:22:54,833
Oh! Urn...

316
00:22:55,542 --> 00:22:58,086
Where do I work?

317
00:22:58,628 --> 00:22:59,880
What?

318
00:23:05,844 --> 00:23:07,888
Tables 6, 7, and 10 are waiting!

319
00:23:08,471 --> 00:23:10,139
Table 12! Taki!

320
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:11,473
Yes.

321
00:23:11,474 --> 00:23:13,017
Here you go.

322
00:23:13,018 --> 00:23:16,020
Uh, zucchini and tomato salad...

323
00:23:16,021 --> 00:23:17,605
We didn't order that.

324
00:23:17,606 --> 00:23:20,107
Taki, I said no more truffles!

325
00:23:20,108 --> 00:23:22,026
Taki, can't hear you!

326
00:23:22,027 --> 00:23:23,111
Taki!

327
00:23:24,487 --> 00:23:26,990
When is this dream going to end?

328
00:23:35,415 --> 00:23:37,583
Hey. Hey waiter.

329
00:23:37,584 --> 00:23:38,919
Oh, yes?

330
00:23:41,046 --> 00:23:43,924
There was a toothpick in the pizza.

331
00:23:44,758 --> 00:23:47,344
We could have gotten hurt.

332
00:23:47,802 --> 00:23:50,055
Good that I noticed earlier.

333
00:23:50,889 --> 00:23:51,932
What do you have to say?

334
00:23:52,682 --> 00:23:54,392
Uh, well...

335
00:23:54,893 --> 00:23:55,936
But...

336
00:23:56,311 --> 00:23:59,022
There are no toothpicks
in an Italian restaurant's...

337
00:24:00,774 --> 00:24:01,816
Excuse me.

338
00:24:02,651 --> 00:24:04,277
Is everything ok?

339
00:24:05,362 --> 00:24:06,821
I'll handle this.

340
00:24:08,156 --> 00:24:09,950
What's wrong with you today?

341
00:24:11,242 --> 00:24:12,953
Please accept our apologies.

342
00:24:13,244 --> 00:24:14,703
Your meal is on the house.

343
00:24:14,704 --> 00:24:15,705
Oh, really?

344
00:24:15,914 --> 00:24:17,874
I hope you weren't hurt.

345
00:24:28,593 --> 00:24:29,843
Urn...

346
00:24:29,844 --> 00:24:31,011
Okudera...

347
00:24:31,012 --> 00:24:32,180
Ms. Okudera.

348
00:24:32,931 --> 00:24:35,099
Ms. Okudera. Thank you...

349
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:36,642
A stroke of bad luck today.

350
00:24:36,643 --> 00:24:37,768
No, uh...

351
00:24:37,769 --> 00:24:39,479
It definitely was a set-up.

352
00:24:39,854 --> 00:24:42,399
Handled it according to the manual, but...

353
00:24:43,566 --> 00:24:46,152
Oh, Ms. Okudera, your skirt!

354
00:24:47,821 --> 00:24:48,862
You OK?

355
00:24:48,863 --> 00:24:50,824
- What happened?
- It is slashed.

356
00:24:51,157 --> 00:24:52,951
That jerk from earlier?

357
00:24:53,201 --> 00:24:55,245
Now what? Do you remember his face?

358
00:24:55,328 --> 00:24:56,204
No.

359
00:24:56,871 --> 00:24:58,289
Come with me.

360
00:24:58,999 --> 00:25:00,083
Hey, Taki!

361
00:25:01,376 --> 00:25:02,752
Take off your skirt.

362
00:25:02,961 --> 00:25:05,588
Oh! I'll look the other way!

363
00:25:09,759 --> 00:25:11,302
This won't take long.

364
00:25:16,057 --> 00:25:17,100
Done!

365
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:22,355
Wow, Taki! It looks better than before!

366
00:25:24,065 --> 00:25:27,652
Thank you for saving me today.

367
00:25:29,195 --> 00:25:32,699
Actually, I was concerned about you.

368
00:25:32,949 --> 00:25:35,785
You're weak but quick-tempered.

369
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:38,621
I like you better today.

370
00:25:39,372 --> 00:25:42,625
Never knew you had a feminine side.

371
00:25:44,044 --> 00:25:46,504
"JR Yamanote Line: 7 min."

372
00:25:53,553 --> 00:25:56,765
What a realistic dream...

373
00:26:01,186 --> 00:26:03,855
Oh, he keeps a diary.

374
00:26:08,318 --> 00:26:09,652
He's so organized.

375
00:26:10,361 --> 00:26:12,363
Wish I lived in Tokyo too.

376
00:26:15,658 --> 00:26:18,203
Oh! That's her!

377
00:26:22,916 --> 00:26:24,667
A crush, maybe?

378
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:33,675
"Walked to the station
with Ms. Okudera after work,

379
00:26:33,676 --> 00:26:37,097
thanks to my feminine powers!"

380
00:26:38,348 --> 00:26:39,891
"Who are you?"

381
00:26:48,858 --> 00:26:54,030
"Mitsuha"

382
00:27:08,461 --> 00:27:09,962
What is this?

383
00:27:09,963 --> 00:27:11,005
"Mitsuha"

384
00:27:14,467 --> 00:27:17,094
Wha... Wha...

385
00:27:17,095 --> 00:27:18,304
What's going on?

386
00:27:18,388 --> 00:27:19,347
"Thanks to my feminine powers!"

387
00:27:20,515 --> 00:27:21,932
Let's go to a cafe again.

388
00:27:21,933 --> 00:27:24,518
Sorry, I have to go to work.

389
00:27:24,519 --> 00:27:26,688
Do you remember where to go?

390
00:27:28,606 --> 00:27:32,318
Tsukasa, did you prank my phone and...

391
00:27:32,902 --> 00:27:35,738
Oh, never mind. See you.

392
00:27:37,031 --> 00:27:39,741
He's acting normal today.

393
00:27:39,742 --> 00:27:42,452
Yesterday he was kind of cute.

394
00:27:42,453 --> 00:27:43,788
What?

395
00:27:46,082 --> 00:27:48,208
Wha... What?

396
00:27:48,209 --> 00:27:50,627
Taki, you tried to outdo us!

397
00:27:50,628 --> 00:27:52,547
You walked home with her!

398
00:27:55,049 --> 00:27:57,676
Did I really? With MS. Okudera?

399
00:27:57,677 --> 00:27:59,220
What happened afterwards?

400
00:28:00,638 --> 00:28:02,682
I don't really remember.

401
00:28:02,765 --> 00:28:04,184
Oh really, now?

402
00:28:04,767 --> 00:28:07,020
Corning through.

403
00:28:08,146 --> 00:28:10,607
- Hi guys.
- Hello.

404
00:28:11,316 --> 00:28:12,859
Let's make this a good one.

405
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:15,528
Right, Taki?

406
00:28:24,954 --> 00:28:26,623
"Mitsuha? Who are you?"

407
00:28:26,748 --> 00:28:27,957
"What are you?"

408
00:28:28,875 --> 00:28:32,044
You're not touching your boobs today.

409
00:28:32,045 --> 00:28:34,881
Breakfast is ready! Hurry up!

410
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:39,219
Boobs?

411
00:28:41,304 --> 00:28:42,889
Morning.

412
00:28:48,728 --> 00:28:51,605
Why is everyone staring at me?

413
00:28:51,606 --> 00:28:55,025
Well you made quite a scene yesterday.

414
00:28:55,026 --> 00:28:56,236
Huh?

415
00:28:57,237 --> 00:28:58,112
"Still life drawing"

416
00:28:58,113 --> 00:29:00,280
Did you see the election posters?

417
00:29:00,281 --> 00:29:01,990
Doesn't matter who wins.

418
00:29:01,991 --> 00:29:03,700
It's all about how to serve up the grants.

419
00:29:03,701 --> 00:29:06,788
Shh! Someone's livelihood depends on it.

420
00:29:07,872 --> 00:29:10,290
They mean me, right?

421
00:29:10,291 --> 00:29:11,918
Well, yeah.

422
00:29:12,794 --> 00:29:14,337
Hey, Mitsuha!

423
00:29:23,972 --> 00:29:29,060
Wha... Wha... I did what?

424
00:29:31,437 --> 00:29:32,772
Mitsuha?

425
00:29:39,862 --> 00:29:42,407
Is this... Could this be...

426
00:29:44,742 --> 00:29:47,577
Could this be that we're really...

427
00:29:47,578 --> 00:29:50,497
In our dreams, that guy and I have...

428
00:29:50,498 --> 00:29:53,084
In our dreams, that girl and I have...

429
00:29:54,294 --> 00:29:55,962
switched places?

430
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:14,564
At last, hello you've opened your eyes

431
00:30:15,064 --> 00:30:19,527
But, why won't you even look me in
the eyes, what't wrong with you?

432
00:30:20,737 --> 00:30:24,574
You angrily tell me that I'm late

433
00:30:25,283 --> 00:30:29,495
Well, I'm sorry, but I did my best
and running at my fastest pace

434
00:30:29,787 --> 00:30:33,165
I started to understand what's going on.

435
00:30:33,166 --> 00:30:36,543
Taki is a boy my age living in Tokyo.

436
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:39,671
I switch with Mitsuha at random,

437
00:30:39,672 --> 00:30:42,091
a few times a week unexpectedly.

438
00:30:42,467 --> 00:30:44,010
Sleep triggers it.

439
00:30:44,177 --> 00:30:44,927
The cause is a mystery.

440
00:30:44,927 --> 00:30:45,803
"Condition: Sleep?
Cause: Unknown"

441
00:30:46,054 --> 00:30:48,013
My memory during the switch is hazy

442
00:30:48,014 --> 00:30:51,183
after I wake up.

443
00:30:51,184 --> 00:30:54,603
But we've definitely switched places.

444
00:30:54,604 --> 00:30:58,315
The reactions of the people
around us is the proof. So...

445
00:30:58,316 --> 00:31:01,818
So we need to lay down some rules

446
00:31:01,819 --> 00:31:02,695
to protect each other's lifestyles.

447
00:31:02,695 --> 00:31:03,571
"Strictly forbidden!"

448
00:31:03,738 --> 00:31:05,405
Things to watch out during the switch

449
00:31:05,406 --> 00:31:06,324
"No baths! No looking! No touching!"

450
00:31:06,407 --> 00:31:07,617
and a list of "don'ts."

451
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:08,701
"Don't waste money! No dialect!
Don't be late!"

452
00:31:08,826 --> 00:31:12,705
We also agreed to leave reports
in our smartphones.

453
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:17,710
To work together to tide over this
mysterious phenomenon.

454
00:31:18,086 --> 00:31:21,339
But...

455
00:31:21,547 --> 00:31:23,673
- That girl!
- That guy!

456
00:31:23,674 --> 00:31:28,428
Back in the Zenzenzense 'til this day,
been looking everywhere for you

457
00:31:28,429 --> 00:31:33,767
I followed the sound of your innocent
laughter and it guided me in the right way

458
00:31:33,768 --> 00:31:38,313
Even if every piece of you disappeared,
and if it scattered everywhere

459
00:31:38,314 --> 00:31:40,942
Guys are staring! Watch the skirt!

460
00:31:41,025 --> 00:31:42,318
Come on, this is basic!

461
00:31:42,443 --> 00:31:43,236
"Careful With skirts!"

462
00:31:46,072 --> 00:31:47,989
Stop wasting my money!

463
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:49,658
It's YOUR body eating.

464
00:31:49,659 --> 00:31:50,827
And I'm working too!

465
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:51,744
"Braided cords..."

466
00:31:51,911 --> 00:31:53,120
Braided cords... I can't do this!

467
00:31:53,121 --> 00:31:55,038
You work too many shifts!

468
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:56,998
It's because you waste my money!

469
00:31:56,999 --> 00:32:00,545
I wonder if we can push our way through

470
00:32:01,379 --> 00:32:05,758
The countless barriers that's waiting
in the future just beyond our view

471
00:32:07,093 --> 00:32:11,013
Side by side, no way we can lose

472
00:32:11,514 --> 00:32:15,977
We'll beat destiny at its own game
and make it follow our own rules

473
00:32:17,019 --> 00:32:19,771
Grabbed coffee with Ms. Okudera.

474
00:32:19,772 --> 00:32:21,481
You two have a good thing going!

475
00:32:21,482 --> 00:32:25,110
Mitsuha, stop changing my relationships!

476
00:32:25,111 --> 00:32:28,697
Taki, why is a girl in love with me?

477
00:32:28,698 --> 00:32:31,284
You're more popular when I'm you.

478
00:32:31,367 --> 00:32:32,160
"Don't think too much of yourself!"

479
00:32:32,326 --> 00:32:33,326
Don't think too much of yourself!

480
00:32:33,327 --> 00:32:34,494
You don't even have a girlfriend!

481
00:32:34,495 --> 00:32:35,787
You don't have a boyfriend!

482
00:32:35,788 --> 00:32:37,248
- I...
- I...

483
00:32:37,415 --> 00:32:38,124
- "Fool"
- "Idiot"

484
00:32:38,125 --> 00:32:40,293
I'm single because I want it!

485
00:33:01,606 --> 00:33:03,316
I feel bad doing this to her

486
00:33:07,361 --> 00:33:09,946
You sure do like your boobs.

487
00:33:09,947 --> 00:33:12,867
We're going now! Get ready!

488
00:33:14,994 --> 00:33:16,244
Comet Tiamat has become visible

489
00:33:16,245 --> 00:33:19,498
to the naked eye for a few days now.

490
00:33:19,499 --> 00:33:21,291
When and where can it be seen?

491
00:33:21,292 --> 00:33:22,168
"Comet Tiamat Reaching Perigee"

492
00:33:22,335 --> 00:33:25,003
Comet Tiamat is moving from east to west

493
00:33:25,004 --> 00:33:27,881
as if to follow the sun.

494
00:33:27,882 --> 00:33:29,925
So it can be seen above Venus...

495
00:33:29,926 --> 00:33:31,969
Why do you wear uniform?

496
00:33:39,685 --> 00:33:44,815
Grandma, why is the body of
our shrine's god so far away?

497
00:33:45,233 --> 00:33:48,735
I don't know. It is because of Mayugoro.

498
00:33:48,736 --> 00:33:49,903
Who's that?

499
00:33:49,904 --> 00:33:51,822
What? He's famous!

500
00:33:59,997 --> 00:34:01,832
Here, Grandma.

501
00:34:06,587 --> 00:34:08,381
Whoa, Mitsuha.

502
00:34:19,767 --> 00:34:21,935
Mitsuha, Yotsuha,

503
00:34:21,936 --> 00:34:24,146
do you know "Musubi"?

504
00:34:24,355 --> 00:34:25,355
Musubi?

505
00:34:25,356 --> 00:34:30,611
Musubi is the old way of calling
the local guardian god.

506
00:34:30,903 --> 00:34:33,698
This word has profound meaning.

507
00:34:34,407 --> 00:34:37,200
It means "Tying thread"

508
00:34:37,201 --> 00:34:40,036
And it also means "Connecting people".

509
00:34:40,037 --> 00:34:42,748
And "The flow of time".

510
00:34:43,124 --> 00:34:45,418
These are all god's power.

511
00:34:46,335 --> 00:34:49,462
So the braided cords that we make

512
00:34:49,463 --> 00:34:51,423
are the god's art

513
00:34:51,424 --> 00:34:54,969
which represent the flow of time itself.

514
00:34:55,761 --> 00:34:58,680
They converge and take shape.

515
00:34:58,681 --> 00:35:01,224
They twist, tangle

516
00:35:01,225 --> 00:35:02,892
sometimes unravel, break,

517
00:35:02,893 --> 00:35:05,146
then connect again.

518
00:35:06,314 --> 00:35:10,234
Musubi is knotting. That's time.

519
00:35:13,154 --> 00:35:14,404
Drink.

520
00:35:14,405 --> 00:35:15,615
Thank you.

521
00:35:16,824 --> 00:35:18,366
I want some too!

522
00:35:18,367 --> 00:35:20,953
That's also Musubi.

523
00:35:21,746 --> 00:35:24,456
Whether it be water, rice, or sake

524
00:35:24,457 --> 00:35:26,708
when a person consumes something and

525
00:35:26,709 --> 00:35:30,170
it joins their soul, that's Musubi.

526
00:35:30,171 --> 00:35:32,797
So today's offering

527
00:35:32,798 --> 00:35:38,137
is an important custom that
connects the god and people.

528
00:35:39,972 --> 00:35:41,515
Hey, I see it!

529
00:35:44,935 --> 00:35:49,690
That's the body of Miyamizu Shrine's god?

530
00:36:06,666 --> 00:36:09,627
Beyond this point is "kakuriyo."

531
00:36:10,419 --> 00:36:12,880
It means the underworld.

532
00:36:13,464 --> 00:36:14,924
It's the underworld!

533
00:36:18,302 --> 00:36:20,345
In exchange for returning to this world,

534
00:36:20,346 --> 00:36:22,931
you must leave behind

535
00:36:22,932 --> 00:36:25,393
what is most important to you.

536
00:36:27,144 --> 00:36:29,063
The kuchikamisake.

537
00:36:30,314 --> 00:36:32,148
The kuchikamisake?

538
00:36:32,149 --> 00:36:36,069
You'll offer it to the god's body.

539
00:36:36,070 --> 00:36:39,365
It's half of you.

540
00:36:40,658 --> 00:36:42,868
Half of Mitsuha...

541
00:37:01,095 --> 00:37:03,013
It's twilight-"kataware-doki"  already.

542
00:37:03,556 --> 00:37:05,516
Kataware-doki?

543
00:37:15,901 --> 00:37:17,068
Oh yeah,

544
00:37:17,069 --> 00:37:18,988
maybe I can see the comet.

545
00:37:20,072 --> 00:37:21,699
The comet?

546
00:37:22,408 --> 00:37:23,325
Oh,

547
00:37:23,826 --> 00:37:25,660
Mitsuha,

548
00:37:25,661 --> 00:37:29,081
you're dreaming right now, aren't you?

549
00:37:40,301 --> 00:37:43,763
Tears? Why?

550
00:37:45,055 --> 00:37:47,141
"I'm almost there. Looking forward to it!"

551
00:37:48,142 --> 00:37:51,645
Ms. Okudera? What's she talking about?

552
00:37:52,855 --> 00:37:54,648
What did Mitsuha do this time?

553
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,526
A date?

554
00:38:05,034 --> 00:38:08,536
A date with Ms. Okudera tomorrow!

555
00:38:08,537 --> 00:38:10,915
Meet at 10:30 a.m. at the station!

556
00:38:12,249 --> 00:38:15,336
Was what I'd planned, but...

557
00:38:29,683 --> 00:38:30,935
Taki.

558
00:38:32,353 --> 00:38:33,770
Sorry. Did you wait long?

559
00:38:33,771 --> 00:38:37,233
Yes. No... Um...

560
00:38:45,908 --> 00:38:47,367
I just got here.

561
00:38:47,368 --> 00:38:50,162
Good. Let's go.

562
00:38:51,288 --> 00:38:54,959
He's so lucky. They must
be together around now...

563
00:38:59,046 --> 00:39:00,005
Hey?

564
00:39:04,009 --> 00:39:05,386
I...

565
00:39:06,512 --> 00:39:08,055
Why?

566
00:39:14,311 --> 00:39:16,896
I wanted to go to this date,

567
00:39:16,897 --> 00:39:19,858
but if it so happens that you

568
00:39:19,859 --> 00:39:22,319
end up going, you better enjoy it!

569
00:39:26,615 --> 00:39:31,078
However, I'm sure you've
never gone out for a date before,

570
00:39:33,038 --> 00:39:35,164
I don't know what to say...

571
00:39:35,165 --> 00:39:36,583
so below are some links

572
00:39:36,584 --> 00:39:39,545
to help you out, you late bloomer.

573
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:40,963
Really?

574
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:42,464
"You can get a girlfriend too!"

575
00:39:43,924 --> 00:39:45,967
"I suffer anxiety but got a girl!

576
00:39:45,968 --> 00:39:47,094
"The dos and don'ts of texting."

577
00:39:48,429 --> 00:39:50,430
She's making fun of me.

578
00:39:50,431 --> 00:39:53,475
"Photo exhibition: Nostalgia"

579
00:40:19,335 --> 00:40:21,170
Taki...

580
00:40:21,754 --> 00:40:24,965
You're like a different person today.

581
00:40:35,184 --> 00:40:38,394
Um, Ms. Okudera. Are you hungry?

582
00:40:38,395 --> 00:40:39,730
How about dinner...

583
00:40:41,023 --> 00:40:42,691
Let's call it a day.

584
00:40:44,568 --> 00:40:45,736
Yes.

585
00:40:46,028 --> 00:40:49,907
Taki, you... Sorry if I'm wrong.

586
00:40:50,783 --> 00:40:54,870
You used to have a bit
of a crush on me, right?

587
00:40:55,746 --> 00:40:58,916
But now you like someone else.

588
00:41:00,626 --> 00:41:02,502
No I don't!

589
00:41:02,503 --> 00:41:03,586
Really?

590
00:41:03,587 --> 00:41:06,255
No! That's not true at all.

591
00:41:06,256 --> 00:41:07,841
I wonder.

592
00:41:09,301 --> 00:41:11,678
Oh well. Thanks for today.

593
00:41:11,679 --> 00:41:13,138
See you at work.

594
00:41:27,277 --> 00:41:29,195
By the time the date is over,

595
00:41:29,196 --> 00:41:33,659
the comet will be visible in the sky.

596
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:38,372
What is she saying?

597
00:41:42,084 --> 00:41:44,753
"Mitsuha Miyamizu"

598
00:42:07,067 --> 00:42:09,820
Oh, it's you, Tessie.

599
00:42:10,821 --> 00:42:14,199
No, I just didn't feel
like going, that's all.

600
00:42:14,450 --> 00:42:15,701
I'm fine.

601
00:42:16,452 --> 00:42:19,997
What? The festival? Well...

602
00:42:20,330 --> 00:42:25,586
Oh yeah, the comet.
Today's it show the peak of its brightness

603
00:42:26,837 --> 00:42:29,673
OK, got it. Later, then.

604
00:42:31,842 --> 00:42:35,219
You just want to see her in a yukata.

605
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:37,346
What I? No!

606
00:42:37,347 --> 00:42:39,183
I didn't even think about it.

607
00:42:41,351 --> 00:42:43,561
Hey, she sounded kind of upset.

608
00:42:43,562 --> 00:42:45,605
Because she didn't want to listen to
your phone call?

609
00:42:45,606 --> 00:42:46,939
May be she is annoyed by you.

610
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:47,940
Sorry I'm late.

611
00:42:47,941 --> 00:42:49,234
- Here she is!
- Finally!

612
00:42:51,028 --> 00:42:54,698
- Your... your...
- Oh! What happened, Mitsuha?

613
00:42:55,699 --> 00:42:57,201
Your hair!

614
00:42:58,118 --> 00:43:00,913
Looks kinda funny, I guess?

615
00:43:09,463 --> 00:43:12,048
Is it because of that boy?

616
00:43:12,049 --> 00:43:13,091
Ditched, maybe?

617
00:43:13,092 --> 00:43:16,344
Why do guys associate
cutting hair with breakups?

618
00:43:16,345 --> 00:43:18,596
She said she just felt like it.

619
00:43:18,597 --> 00:43:20,139
Really?

620
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:22,141
She just felt like cutting
off that much hair?

621
00:43:22,142 --> 00:43:25,270
Oh! Hey! You can see it!

622
00:43:43,539 --> 00:43:45,624
Wow!

623
00:44:03,976 --> 00:44:09,606
The number you have called
is not available...

624
00:44:12,151 --> 00:44:14,735
I'll tell her about this disastrous date

625
00:44:14,736 --> 00:44:17,530
next time we switch,

626
00:44:17,531 --> 00:44:20,576
I thought. But...

627
00:44:20,868 --> 00:44:23,120
For some reason, after that,

628
00:44:23,829 --> 00:44:27,541
Mitsuha and I never switched places again.

629
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:05,120
"Mountains in Gifu Prefecture"

630
00:45:16,965 --> 00:45:18,175
"Hida mountains"

631
00:46:20,988 --> 00:46:25,492
What... What are you doing here?

632
00:46:28,328 --> 00:46:30,622
Tsukasa told me and here I am!

633
00:46:34,668 --> 00:46:36,003
Tsukasa, I asked you to cover for me

634
00:46:36,628 --> 00:46:40,214
at home and at work.

635
00:46:40,215 --> 00:46:41,841
Takagi will cover your shift.

636
00:46:41,842 --> 00:46:45,053
Leave it to me! But you owe me a meal!

637
00:46:45,345 --> 00:46:46,971
This isn't funny.

638
00:46:46,972 --> 00:46:49,432
- We were worried about you.
- Huh?

639
00:46:49,433 --> 00:46:50,683
You can't go alone.

640
00:46:50,684 --> 00:46:52,643
What if it's a con act?

641
00:46:52,644 --> 00:46:53,894
A con act?

642
00:46:53,895 --> 00:46:56,272
You're meeting an online friend.

643
00:46:56,273 --> 00:46:58,691
Well no, not exactly...

644
00:46:58,692 --> 00:47:01,194
- I think he's using a dating site.
- No!

645
00:47:01,778 --> 00:47:04,405
You've been acting weird lately.

646
00:47:04,406 --> 00:47:05,573
We'll keep an eye on you.

647
00:47:05,574 --> 00:47:07,492
I'm not a kid!

648
00:47:09,536 --> 00:47:11,329
The switching stopped.

649
00:47:11,330 --> 00:47:13,832
My calls and texts didn't go through.

650
00:47:14,791 --> 00:47:18,503
So I decided to go see Mitsuha in person.

651
00:47:19,546 --> 00:47:22,549
I wanted to meet her. But...

652
00:47:24,259 --> 00:47:27,428
What? You don't know where?

653
00:47:27,429 --> 00:47:29,764
The town's scenery is your only clue?

654
00:47:29,765 --> 00:47:30,766
Yes.

655
00:47:33,435 --> 00:47:35,145
And you can't contact her?

656
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:36,979
What's this all about?

657
00:47:36,980 --> 00:47:39,815
Seriously. What a lousy tour planner.

658
00:47:39,816 --> 00:47:41,192
I did not plan a tour!

659
00:47:41,193 --> 00:47:44,321
Oh well. We'll help you look for her.

660
00:47:44,654 --> 00:47:47,240
Oh how cute! Look!

661
00:47:47,908 --> 00:47:48,949
So annoying.

662
00:47:48,950 --> 00:47:50,452
Oh, it moved!

663
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:21,273
So it's impossible after all...

664
00:48:21,274 --> 00:48:25,153
What? After all the
trouble we went through?

665
00:48:27,948 --> 00:48:30,450
You haven't done anything.

666
00:48:33,537 --> 00:48:36,705
A Takayama ramen.

667
00:48:36,706 --> 00:48:38,541
Oh, then a Takayama ramen.

668
00:48:38,542 --> 00:48:41,962
- OK. 3 ramens.
- OK.

669
00:48:43,797 --> 00:48:46,257
Can we return to Tokyo today?

670
00:48:46,258 --> 00:48:49,510
We could be cutting it close. I'll check.

671
00:48:49,511 --> 00:48:50,470
Thanks.

672
00:48:50,471 --> 00:48:52,764
Are you all right with that?

673
00:48:55,434 --> 00:48:59,479
I'm starting to feel like
I'm barking up the wrong tree.

674
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:07,487
Why young man, that's Itomori, isn't it?

675
00:49:08,864 --> 00:49:12,325
It's a very good drawing. Isn't it, dear?

676
00:49:13,743 --> 00:49:17,329
Yeah, it's Itomori. Brings back memories.

677
00:49:17,330 --> 00:49:19,748
He was born in Itomori.

678
00:49:19,749 --> 00:49:20,792
Itomori...

679
00:49:22,878 --> 00:49:25,296
Yes! Itomori Town! That's it!

680
00:49:25,297 --> 00:49:27,923
It's nearby, isn't it?

681
00:49:27,924 --> 00:49:30,926
- What are you...
- Itomori was...

682
00:49:30,927 --> 00:49:33,596
Itomori? No way!

683
00:49:33,597 --> 00:49:35,974
Is it where that comet...

684
00:49:44,399 --> 00:49:50,780
"Keep Out"

685
00:50:25,774 --> 00:50:29,109
Hey. Is this really the place?

686
00:50:29,110 --> 00:50:32,822
No way! Taki must remember wrong.

687
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:36,660
No. I'm sure it is the place.

688
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:39,787
This schoolyard. The mountains.

689
00:50:39,788 --> 00:50:42,790
I remember this high school clearly!

690
00:50:42,791 --> 00:50:44,792
That can't be true!

691
00:50:44,793 --> 00:50:47,711
Surely you remember that disaster

692
00:50:47,712 --> 00:50:49,548
that took hundreds of lives 3 years ago!

693
00:50:50,674 --> 00:50:52,217
Died?

694
00:50:53,051 --> 00:50:56,346
Died 3 years ago?

695
00:50:58,265 --> 00:50:59,890
That can't be.

696
00:50:59,891 --> 00:51:03,937
I still have the memos
that she left behind...

697
00:51:21,371 --> 00:51:22,706
They're disappearing...

698
00:51:32,382 --> 00:51:33,674
Comet Tiamat,

699
00:51:33,675 --> 00:51:35,260
with an orbital period of 1,200 years,

700
00:51:35,385 --> 00:51:36,177
"Itomori, the Town that Vanished"

701
00:51:36,261 --> 00:51:39,389
made a close approach to Earth
3 years ago in October.

702
00:51:39,556 --> 00:51:40,307
"Meteor Strikes, Wipes out Town"

703
00:51:40,308 --> 00:51:41,975
Nobody predicted that its nucleus

704
00:51:42,267 --> 00:51:43,727
would split at its perigee.

705
00:51:45,478 --> 00:51:47,229
"Town Annihilated"

706
00:51:47,230 --> 00:51:48,856
"Over 500 dead or missing"

707
00:51:48,857 --> 00:51:50,274
"Itomori, the Town that Vanished"

708
00:51:50,275 --> 00:51:51,817
"October 4, 2013-Itomori vanished."

709
00:51:51,818 --> 00:51:54,403
A fragment of the comet became

710
00:51:54,404 --> 00:51:55,487
a meteor that struck Japan.

711
00:51:55,488 --> 00:51:57,573
"Itomori, comet, damage"

712
00:51:57,574 --> 00:52:01,411
It was the day of the autumn festival.

713
00:52:01,745 --> 00:52:03,913
The point of impact was here.

714
00:52:04,706 --> 00:52:08,834
At 8:42 p.m., it struck where people

715
00:52:08,835 --> 00:52:10,003
were gathered for the festival.

716
00:52:12,380 --> 00:52:14,131
"List of the Names of Victims"

717
00:52:14,132 --> 00:52:16,383
Over 500 people died,

718
00:52:16,384 --> 00:52:18,469
a third of the town's population,

719
00:52:18,470 --> 00:52:22,307
and now nobody lives in Itomori anymore.

720
00:52:30,106 --> 00:52:33,526
Tessie and Sayaka...

721
00:52:34,903 --> 00:52:37,655
"Mitsuha Miyamizu"

722
00:52:37,656 --> 00:52:39,115
That's her?

723
00:52:39,741 --> 00:52:41,742
It has to be some kind of mistake.

724
00:52:41,743 --> 00:52:44,745
This person died 3 years ago!

725
00:52:44,746 --> 00:52:47,373
Just 2, 3 weeks ago, she said to me

726
00:52:47,374 --> 00:52:51,126
that the comet would be visible.

727
00:52:51,127 --> 00:52:52,211
So...

728
00:52:52,212 --> 00:52:53,380
You're dreaming now...

729
00:52:54,547 --> 00:52:55,507
I...

730
00:52:55,508 --> 00:52:57,300
Aren't you?

731
00:52:58,093 --> 00:52:59,302
I...

732
00:53:01,388 --> 00:53:02,639
What did I...

733
00:53:16,986 --> 00:53:18,987
Lively up there.

734
00:53:18,988 --> 00:53:21,615
I'm sorry we could only get one room.

735
00:53:21,616 --> 00:53:23,284
No problem.

736
00:53:24,202 --> 00:53:25,244
How's Taki?

737
00:53:25,245 --> 00:53:28,539
He's still reading articles on Itomori.

738
00:53:28,540 --> 00:53:30,499
Newspapers and magazines

739
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:32,502
at the time at random it seems.

740
00:53:37,006 --> 00:53:38,424
What?

741
00:53:38,425 --> 00:53:40,718
Nothing. I didn't know you smoke.

742
00:53:40,719 --> 00:53:43,847
Oh. I quit recently, but...

743
00:53:44,806 --> 00:53:48,059
What do you think about Taki's story?

744
00:53:51,187 --> 00:53:53,314
I liked him.

745
00:53:53,898 --> 00:53:58,068
The way he was recently. He was always

746
00:53:58,069 --> 00:53:59,696
a nice guy, but even more so lately.

747
00:54:00,238 --> 00:54:03,700
Like he was trying so hard. It was cute.

748
00:54:04,868 --> 00:54:08,872
What he's saying doesn't
make sense to me...

749
00:54:11,249 --> 00:54:14,418
But I'm sure he met someone

750
00:54:14,419 --> 00:54:16,629
and that someone changed him.

751
00:54:18,173 --> 00:54:20,341
That much is for sure, I think.

752
00:54:20,467 --> 00:54:21,426
"Worst-ever Itomori Cornet Disaster"

753
00:54:34,898 --> 00:54:37,358
It was all just a dream.

754
00:54:38,693 --> 00:54:41,069
I recognized the scenery because

755
00:54:41,070 --> 00:54:44,657
I remembered the news from 3 years ago.

756
00:54:45,658 --> 00:54:49,161
If not that, then... a ghost?

757
00:54:49,162 --> 00:54:54,125
No... Was I fantasizing?

758
00:54:57,837 --> 00:55:01,966
Her name... What was it?

759
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:07,179
Tsukasa went to take a bath.

760
00:55:07,180 --> 00:55:09,849
Oh, Ms. Okudera.

761
00:55:09,933 --> 00:55:14,187
I, uh... I've been saying
such strange things.

762
00:55:14,854 --> 00:55:17,023
Thank you for coming along today.

763
00:55:20,652 --> 00:55:22,069
No problem.

764
00:55:22,070 --> 00:55:23,987
"Tatara Iron Making Site"

765
00:55:23,988 --> 00:55:25,489
"Braided Cords of Itomori"

766
00:55:25,490 --> 00:55:28,034
Braided cords. How pretty.

767
00:55:28,618 --> 00:55:31,704
Is that a braided cord you're wearing?

768
00:55:32,664 --> 00:55:38,752
Oh, this... I think someone
gave it to me a long time ago.

769
00:55:38,753 --> 00:55:42,507
I wear it sometimes as
kind of a lucky charm...

770
00:55:44,884 --> 00:55:45,927
Who was it?

771
00:55:48,221 --> 00:55:51,431
Why don't you go take a bath, too?

772
00:55:51,432 --> 00:55:53,268
Yes... No.

773
00:55:56,187 --> 00:56:00,941
Someone who makes braided
cords told me before...

774
00:56:00,942 --> 00:56:03,611
The cords represent the
flow of time itself.

775
00:56:04,070 --> 00:56:07,365
The threads twist, tangle,

776
00:56:07,782 --> 00:56:11,286
unravel, and connect again. That's time...

777
00:56:12,370 --> 00:56:13,872
Maybe at that place...

778
00:56:31,639 --> 00:56:32,807
"Around here?"

779
00:56:39,731 --> 00:56:40,857
Taki.

780
00:56:41,900 --> 00:56:43,234
Taki.

781
00:56:44,068 --> 00:56:45,612
Taki.

782
00:56:46,738 --> 00:56:48,990
Don't you remember me?

783
00:57:02,921 --> 00:57:04,254
"I have to go somewhere.

784
00:57:04,255 --> 00:57:05,214
"Return to Tokyo without me.

785
00:57:05,381 --> 00:57:06,506
"I'll return later.

786
00:57:06,507 --> 00:57:07,300
"Thanks."

787
00:57:11,262 --> 00:57:12,430
Taki...

788
00:57:36,412 --> 00:57:39,040
Eat this up there.

789
00:57:39,749 --> 00:57:43,920
Your drawing of Itomori... It was good.

790
00:58:20,915 --> 00:58:23,418
They converge and take shape.

791
00:58:23,835 --> 00:58:25,794
They twist, tangle,

792
00:58:25,795 --> 00:58:27,671
sometimes unravel,

793
00:58:27,672 --> 00:58:29,632
then connect again...

794
00:58:30,508 --> 00:58:35,471
Musubi-knotting. That's time.

795
00:58:45,398 --> 00:58:46,441
There it is!

796
00:58:48,693 --> 00:58:50,486
It's really there!

797
00:58:51,821 --> 00:58:54,782
It wasn't just a dream!

798
00:59:25,063 --> 00:59:27,774
From here is the underworld.

799
00:59:51,172 --> 00:59:53,800
It's the sake we brought.

800
00:59:55,176 --> 00:59:58,387
This is her sister's, and this is mine.

801
01:00:01,390 --> 01:00:03,434
Before the comet struck...

802
01:00:04,268 --> 01:00:08,773
So the Mitsuha I know is from 3 years ago?

803
01:00:10,066 --> 01:00:13,736
Our timelines weren't in sync.

804
01:00:14,779 --> 01:00:16,948
Half of her...

805
01:00:31,629 --> 01:00:33,005
Musubi.

806
01:00:34,382 --> 01:00:37,009
If time can really be turned back,

807
01:00:38,261 --> 01:00:39,679
give me one last chance...

808
01:00:54,443 --> 01:00:55,862
A comet!

809
01:02:01,093 --> 01:02:04,513
Your name is Mitsuha.

810
01:02:10,686 --> 01:02:13,188
You're both my treasures.

811
01:02:13,189 --> 01:02:15,482
You're a big sister now.

812
01:02:15,483 --> 01:02:17,360
"Get well soon, Mom."

813
01:02:18,152 --> 01:02:20,821
I'm so sorry, my dears.

814
01:02:22,198 --> 01:02:25,618
Dad, when is Morn going to come home?

815
01:02:26,827 --> 01:02:28,036
I couldn't save her.

816
01:02:28,037 --> 01:02:30,163
Get a hold of yourself!

817
01:02:30,164 --> 01:02:31,665
Who cares about the shrine?

818
01:02:31,666 --> 01:02:33,291
You're the adopted son-in-law!

819
01:02:33,292 --> 01:02:34,961
I loved my wife Futaba.

820
01:02:35,419 --> 01:02:36,544
Not Miyamizu Shrine.

821
01:02:36,545 --> 01:02:38,214
Get out of here!

822
01:02:40,341 --> 01:02:43,134
Mitsuha, Yotsuha,

823
01:02:43,135 --> 01:02:46,138
you'll be with Grandma from now on.

824
01:02:50,893 --> 01:02:52,602
- Who am I?
- "Who are you?"

825
01:02:52,603 --> 01:02:53,937
- No, who are you?
- "Mitsuha"

826
01:02:53,938 --> 01:02:54,605
"Fool"

827
01:02:54,606 --> 01:02:55,730
Don't think too much of yourself.

828
01:02:55,731 --> 01:02:57,233
You don't even have a girlfriend

829
01:02:57,400 --> 01:03:00,736
He's so lucky. They must
be together around now...

830
01:03:02,446 --> 01:03:03,655
I...

831
01:03:03,656 --> 01:03:04,990
I'm going to Tokyo.

832
01:03:04,991 --> 01:03:06,659
What? Hey, Mitsuha!

833
01:03:09,161 --> 01:03:13,082
Grandma, could you do me a favor?

834
01:03:13,874 --> 01:03:16,502
Oh yeah, the comet.

835
01:03:17,003 --> 01:03:20,088
Today's the peak of its brightness...

836
01:03:20,089 --> 01:03:22,633
Mitsuha! Don't stay there!

837
01:03:23,134 --> 01:03:27,888
Mitsuha, get out of there
before the comet strikes!

838
01:03:30,099 --> 01:03:32,059
Mitsuha, get out of there!

839
01:03:32,852 --> 01:03:35,062
Mitsuha! Mitsuha!

840
01:03:35,479 --> 01:03:37,732
Mitsuha!

841
01:03:55,708 --> 01:03:59,045
I'm Mitsuha! She's still alive!

842
01:04:09,722 --> 01:04:12,391
Mitsuha, are you touching...

843
01:04:14,352 --> 01:04:16,103
My sister!

844
01:04:18,272 --> 01:04:20,316
Yotsuha!

845
01:04:23,361 --> 01:04:25,905
Mitsuha has finally lost it.

846
01:04:26,322 --> 01:04:28,866
I'm leaving without her.

847
01:04:29,116 --> 01:04:31,201
She's lost it.

848
01:04:31,202 --> 01:04:33,828
She's completely lost it.

849
01:04:33,829 --> 01:04:35,081
Scary.

850
01:04:35,331 --> 01:04:39,834
Comet Tiamat has been visible
to the naked eye for a few days now.

851
01:04:39,835 --> 01:04:43,797
Tonight it will finally reach
its perigee around 7:40 p.m.,

852
01:04:43,798 --> 01:04:46,549
and will achieve its maximum brightness.

853
01:04:46,550 --> 01:04:49,345
It's tonight. There's still time.

854
01:04:50,096 --> 01:04:51,889
Good morning, Mitsuha.

855
01:04:52,306 --> 01:04:53,391
Oh...

856
01:04:54,517 --> 01:04:57,645
You're not Mitsuha, are you?

857
01:04:58,270 --> 01:05:01,565
You knew, Grandma?

858
01:05:01,982 --> 01:05:08,697
No, but watching the way you behaved lately
triggered some memories.

859
01:05:09,448 --> 01:05:11,617
I also remember seeing strange dreams

860
01:05:11,909 --> 01:05:14,995
when I was a young girl.

861
01:05:15,996 --> 01:05:18,832
Although now I've forgotten about

862
01:05:18,833 --> 01:05:21,794
whose life I was dreaming about.

863
01:05:22,461 --> 01:05:23,711
Forgotten...

864
01:05:23,712 --> 01:05:25,630
Treasure the experience.

865
01:05:25,631 --> 01:05:28,801
Dreams fade away after you wake up.

866
01:05:29,260 --> 01:05:31,845
There were times your mother and I

867
01:05:31,846 --> 01:05:33,889
had similar experiences.

868
01:05:34,765 --> 01:05:38,811
Maybe those dreams that
the Miyamizu people had

869
01:05:39,103 --> 01:05:42,022
were all for what will happen today.

870
01:05:42,523 --> 01:05:44,650
Grandma, listen.

871
01:05:45,109 --> 01:05:48,487
A comet will strike Itomori tonight

872
01:05:48,988 --> 01:05:50,156
and everyone will die.

873
01:05:57,371 --> 01:05:59,248
"Nobody will believe that"?

874
01:05:59,832 --> 01:06:02,460
What a surprisingly
ordinary reply, Grandma.

875
01:06:03,169 --> 01:06:05,629
I won't let them die!

876
01:06:06,547 --> 01:06:09,215
Oh! What happened, Mitsuha?

877
01:06:09,216 --> 01:06:13,761
Your... your hair!

878
01:06:13,762 --> 01:06:16,347
Oh, this. It looked better before, huh?

879
01:06:16,348 --> 01:06:17,974
Oh, that's it?

880
01:06:17,975 --> 01:06:20,768
Forget that! If nothing is done,

881
01:06:20,769 --> 01:06:22,062
everyone will die tonight!

882
01:06:24,398 --> 01:06:26,859
So we have to do something!

883
01:06:31,363 --> 01:06:33,281
Why aren't you at school?

884
01:06:33,282 --> 01:06:38,245
Uh... We have to save the town.

885
01:06:39,538 --> 01:06:40,872
The community wireless system?

886
01:06:40,873 --> 01:06:43,541
Yeah, those speakers you see everywhere.

887
01:06:43,542 --> 01:06:46,462
"Superimposition, frequency"

888
01:06:48,005 --> 01:06:50,216
I see! That could work!

889
01:06:50,549 --> 01:06:52,050
You're awesome, Tessie!

890
01:06:52,051 --> 01:06:54,594
Hey! Don't come so close!

891
01:06:54,595 --> 01:06:56,930
What, embarrassed? Hey, hey!

892
01:06:56,931 --> 01:07:00,059
Stop! You're a girl of marriageable age!

893
01:07:00,476 --> 01:07:02,143
"Club Discontinued-Keep Out"

894
01:07:02,144 --> 01:07:04,939
You're such a nice guy!

895
01:07:08,192 --> 01:07:10,485
Got them. Here's your change.

896
01:07:10,486 --> 01:07:11,903
Sorry, Sayaka.

897
01:07:11,904 --> 01:07:13,446
It's all right.

898
01:07:13,447 --> 01:07:16,492
- What a cheap fee.
- Deal with it.

899
01:07:17,743 --> 01:07:19,619
What about you?

900
01:07:19,620 --> 01:07:21,789
Have you come up with an escape plan?

901
01:07:25,084 --> 01:07:28,086
What? A bomb?

902
01:07:28,087 --> 01:07:30,255
We have water gel explosives

903
01:07:30,256 --> 01:07:32,549
for construction at our storage site.

904
01:07:32,550 --> 01:07:34,300
Broadcast hijacking?

905
01:07:34,301 --> 01:07:36,135
The town's wireless system can be easily

906
01:07:36,136 --> 01:07:39,138
jacked using the startup frequency.

907
01:07:39,139 --> 01:07:41,140
So we can broadcast an evacuation

908
01:07:41,141 --> 01:07:43,351
warning from the school.

909
01:07:43,352 --> 01:07:45,770
The school is outside the disaster area,

910
01:07:45,771 --> 01:07:48,148
so people can evacuate here.

911
01:07:48,691 --> 01:07:51,359
It's... It's totally a crime!

912
01:07:51,360 --> 01:07:53,027
You do the broadcast.

913
01:07:53,028 --> 01:07:54,028
Why?

914
01:07:54,029 --> 01:07:55,447
You're in the broadcast club.

915
01:07:55,781 --> 01:07:57,532
I'm in charge of explosives.

916
01:07:57,533 --> 01:07:59,827
I'll go talk to the mayor.

917
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:02,120
In the end, the city council

918
01:08:02,121 --> 01:08:04,080
has to evacuate everyone.

919
01:08:04,081 --> 01:08:07,250
I'm his daughter. I can persuade him.

920
01:08:07,251 --> 01:08:09,086
It's a perfect plan.

921
01:08:10,546 --> 01:08:13,298
Oh, whatever.

922
01:08:13,299 --> 01:08:15,425
It's just a what-if fantasy, isn't it?

923
01:08:15,426 --> 01:08:17,719
What? Well...

924
01:08:17,720 --> 01:08:19,305
Not necessarily!

925
01:08:19,680 --> 01:08:21,473
Do you know how Lake Itomori was formed?

926
01:08:21,557 --> 01:08:22,224
"A meteor crater lake
formed 1,200 years ago."

927
01:08:22,391 --> 01:08:23,975
It's a meteor crater!

928
01:08:23,976 --> 01:08:27,895
So one did strike this
area a thousand years ago!

929
01:08:27,896 --> 01:08:30,064
Oh! So that's why...

930
01:08:30,065 --> 01:08:33,235
You're right, Tessie!

931
01:08:35,654 --> 01:08:38,282
Let's do it together!

932
01:08:41,577 --> 01:08:44,163
What on earth are you talking about?

933
01:08:46,123 --> 01:08:49,542
I said we have to evacuate everyone

934
01:08:49,543 --> 01:08:51,211
- in town before tonight or...
- Shut your mouth.

935
01:08:56,884 --> 01:08:59,261
"The comet will split and strike the town"?

936
01:08:59,345 --> 01:09:00,262
"Itomori Town Hall"

937
01:09:00,512 --> 01:09:02,681
"Over 500 people will die"?

938
01:09:03,515 --> 01:09:06,435
How dare you spout such nonsense?

939
01:09:07,019 --> 01:09:10,189
If you're serious, then you're sick.

940
01:09:10,522 --> 01:09:13,442
Madness must be from the Miyamizu side.

941
01:09:14,735 --> 01:09:18,364
I'll get someone to drive you
to a hospital in the city.

942
01:09:19,323 --> 01:09:23,369
I'll listen to you after
a doctor examines you.

943
01:09:26,372 --> 01:09:28,499
You son of a...

944
01:09:36,382 --> 01:09:39,927
Mitsuha! No...

945
01:09:40,844 --> 01:09:41,929
Who...

946
01:09:43,681 --> 01:09:45,391
Who are you?

947
01:09:59,321 --> 01:10:01,572
See you later at the festival.

948
01:10:01,573 --> 01:10:03,408
Let's meet at the shrine.

949
01:10:03,409 --> 01:10:04,617
- Don't be late.
- Bye!

950
01:10:04,618 --> 01:10:06,245
- See you.
- Later.

951
01:10:07,746 --> 01:10:09,164
You shouldn't go!

952
01:10:09,665 --> 01:10:12,291
Get out of town. Tell your friends.

953
01:10:12,292 --> 01:10:13,584
What are you saying?

954
01:10:13,585 --> 01:10:14,711
Mitsuha!

955
01:10:14,712 --> 01:10:17,380
- What was that?
- Let's go.

956
01:10:17,381 --> 01:10:19,299
What are you doing?

957
01:10:20,175 --> 01:10:22,093
Could Mitsuha...

958
01:10:22,094 --> 01:10:24,345
Could she have persuaded them?

959
01:10:24,346 --> 01:10:25,764
Is it my fault?

960
01:10:26,181 --> 01:10:29,935
Yotsuha, leave town with
Grandma before nightfall.

961
01:10:30,310 --> 01:10:32,019
You'll die if you stay here!

962
01:10:32,020 --> 01:10:34,105
What are you saying?

963
01:10:34,106 --> 01:10:36,524
Yesterday you suddenly went to Tokyo.

964
01:10:36,525 --> 01:10:38,861
What's wrong with you?

965
01:10:40,362 --> 01:10:41,613
Tokyo?

966
01:10:41,864 --> 01:10:44,533
Hey, Mitsuha!

967
01:10:46,744 --> 01:10:48,787
How did it go with your old man?

968
01:10:50,998 --> 01:10:52,583
Hey, Mitsuha?

969
01:10:53,208 --> 01:10:54,709
What's wrong with her?

970
01:10:54,710 --> 01:10:55,753
No idea.

971
01:11:05,929 --> 01:11:07,723
Are you there?

972
01:11:08,515 --> 01:11:11,184
Is something over there?

973
01:11:11,185 --> 01:11:12,727
Let me use your bike.

974
01:11:12,728 --> 01:11:13,895
Hey, what the...

975
01:11:13,896 --> 01:11:15,063
Hey, Mitsuha!

976
01:11:16,356 --> 01:11:17,732
What about our plan?

977
01:11:17,733 --> 01:11:20,151
Get ready as planned!

978
01:11:20,152 --> 01:11:21,361
Please!

979
01:11:47,429 --> 01:11:50,516
I'm Taki again.

980
01:11:53,560 --> 01:11:56,438
What's Taki doing here?

981
01:12:05,531 --> 01:12:06,824
The town...

982
01:12:07,491 --> 01:12:08,826
is gone.

983
01:12:18,293 --> 01:12:21,839
At that moment... did I...

984
01:12:25,259 --> 01:12:26,844
die?

985
01:12:36,562 --> 01:12:39,857
Taki. Taki.

986
01:12:41,984 --> 01:12:44,236
Don't you remember me?

987
01:12:56,290 --> 01:12:58,374
I'm going to Tokyo.

988
01:12:58,375 --> 01:13:00,126
What? Now?

989
01:13:00,127 --> 01:13:01,711
Why?

990
01:13:01,712 --> 01:13:02,920
A date.

991
01:13:02,921 --> 01:13:05,172
You have a boyfriend in Tokyo?

992
01:13:05,173 --> 01:13:07,467
Not my date.

993
01:13:08,635 --> 01:13:10,387
I'll come home tonight.

994
01:13:13,307 --> 01:13:15,349
If I suddenly showed up,

995
01:13:15,350 --> 01:13:18,353
would I bother him? Surprise him?

996
01:13:18,812 --> 01:13:22,065
He might not like it.

997
01:13:29,156 --> 01:13:32,909
The number you are trying to call
is not available...

998
01:13:32,910 --> 01:13:34,494
There's no way we could meet.

999
01:13:34,953 --> 01:13:37,080
But what if we did?

1000
01:13:37,873 --> 01:13:40,751
What should I do? Would I annoy him?

1001
01:13:41,168 --> 01:13:42,127
Would it be awkward?

1002
01:13:42,128 --> 01:13:43,128
"Tiamat Makes Closest Approach Tomorrow"

1003
01:13:43,129 --> 01:13:45,130
Or maybe...

1004
01:13:46,173 --> 01:13:49,092
he'd be a bit glad to see me?

1005
01:13:50,010 --> 01:13:54,139
The number you've called
is not available...

1006
01:13:55,015 --> 01:13:57,434
There's no way we could meet.

1007
01:13:58,435 --> 01:13:59,645
But...

1008
01:14:01,229 --> 01:14:03,732
one thing is certain.

1009
01:14:04,608 --> 01:14:08,695
If we see each other, we'll know.

1010
01:14:09,446 --> 01:14:12,366
That you were the one who was inside me.

1011
01:14:13,659 --> 01:14:16,370
That I was the one who was inside you.

1012
01:14:16,787 --> 01:14:17,829
I'm sorry.

1013
01:14:49,611 --> 01:14:50,904
Excuse me.

1014
01:15:23,395 --> 01:15:24,855
That time 3 years ago,

1015
01:15:25,188 --> 01:15:27,566
before I got to know you...

1016
01:15:31,153 --> 01:15:32,362
Taki.

1017
01:15:33,613 --> 01:15:34,698
Taki.

1018
01:15:36,742 --> 01:15:37,951
Taki.

1019
01:15:39,202 --> 01:15:40,954
Urn... It's me.

1020
01:15:43,498 --> 01:15:45,792
Don't you remember me?

1021
01:15:47,085 --> 01:15:48,587
Who are you?

1022
01:15:53,467 --> 01:15:54,760
I'm sorry.

1023
01:16:02,559 --> 01:16:04,102
But he's Taki.

1024
01:16:05,228 --> 01:16:06,563
Weird girl.

1025
01:16:07,064 --> 01:16:11,443
This is Yotsuya Station.

1026
01:16:15,822 --> 01:16:16,865
Hey!

1027
01:16:17,908 --> 01:16:19,367
What's your name?

1028
01:16:20,035 --> 01:16:21,119
Mitsuha!

1029
01:16:21,536 --> 01:16:23,914
My name is Mitsuha!

1030
01:16:31,004 --> 01:16:36,009
That time 3 years ago, you came...

1031
01:16:36,718 --> 01:16:38,345
to see me!

1032
01:16:49,523 --> 01:16:50,732
Taki?

1033
01:16:59,157 --> 01:17:02,035
Mitsuha!

1034
01:17:02,202 --> 01:17:03,411
Taki?

1035
01:17:17,759 --> 01:17:19,553
Mitsuha!

1036
01:17:19,970 --> 01:17:23,640
You're here, aren't you? Inside my body!

1037
01:17:24,182 --> 01:17:25,559
Taki!

1038
01:17:26,184 --> 01:17:28,478
Taki, where are you?

1039
01:17:29,062 --> 01:17:30,230
It's Mitsuha.

1040
01:17:30,647 --> 01:17:32,566
I can hear her, but...

1041
01:17:33,608 --> 01:17:36,944
Taki, where are you?

1042
01:17:36,945 --> 01:17:38,363
Taki!

1043
01:17:51,126 --> 01:17:53,628
Taki, are you...

1044
01:17:54,838 --> 01:17:56,298
there?

1045
01:18:20,947 --> 01:18:22,824
It's twilight-"kataware-doki."

1046
01:18:37,797 --> 01:18:38,965
Mitsuha.

1047
01:18:45,263 --> 01:18:46,514
Taki.

1048
01:18:47,933 --> 01:18:51,770
Taki. It's really you.

1049
01:18:55,398 --> 01:18:56,565
Taki!

1050
01:18:56,566 --> 01:18:58,443
I came to see you.

1051
01:18:59,110 --> 01:19:01,111
It wasn't easy because

1052
01:19:01,112 --> 01:19:03,155
you were so far away.

1053
01:19:03,156 --> 01:19:08,160
But how? At that moment, I...

1054
01:19:08,161 --> 01:19:10,664
I drank your kuchikamisake.

1055
01:19:14,668 --> 01:19:16,878
You drank that?

1056
01:19:17,921 --> 01:19:19,464
You idiot! Pervert!

1057
01:19:20,131 --> 01:19:23,217
Oh yeah, and you touched my boobs!

1058
01:19:23,218 --> 01:19:25,302
How do you know that?

1059
01:19:25,303 --> 01:19:26,971
Yotsuha saw it.

1060
01:19:26,972 --> 01:19:29,598
Oh! Sorry, I couldn't help it!

1061
01:19:29,599 --> 01:19:30,767
It was just once.

1062
01:19:30,892 --> 01:19:32,352
Just once?

1063
01:19:34,646 --> 01:19:36,564
Doesn't matter how many times! Jerk.

1064
01:19:37,232 --> 01:19:38,191
Sorry.

1065
01:19:38,525 --> 01:19:40,819
Oh, this...

1066
01:19:41,194 --> 01:19:45,323
Oh. Really, Why'd you come see me
before I knew you?

1067
01:19:45,865 --> 01:19:47,325
There's no way I'd recognize you.

1068
01:19:47,784 --> 01:19:51,371
Here. I kept it for 3 years.

1069
01:19:52,289 --> 01:19:54,582
Now you keep it.

1070
01:19:55,583 --> 01:19:56,710
Yes.

1071
01:20:04,759 --> 01:20:05,844
How is it?

1072
01:20:07,053 --> 01:20:08,263
Not bad.

1073
01:20:08,805 --> 01:20:10,180
You're lying!

1074
01:20:10,181 --> 01:20:12,599
No, I... Sorry.

1075
01:20:12,600 --> 01:20:14,811
You're really so...

1076
01:20:27,782 --> 01:20:31,411
Mitsuha, you still have things to do.
Listen.

1077
01:20:34,664 --> 01:20:35,623
It's coming.

1078
01:20:36,207 --> 01:20:38,667
Don't worry. You've still got time.

1079
01:20:38,668 --> 01:20:40,837
Yes, I'll try.

1080
01:20:42,964 --> 01:20:45,299
Kataware-doki is almost...

1081
01:20:45,300 --> 01:20:46,718
over.

1082
01:20:48,553 --> 01:20:52,349
Hey, Mitsuha.
So we don't forget when we wake up...

1083
01:20:57,103 --> 01:21:00,690
Let's write our names on each other. Here.

1084
01:21:02,400 --> 01:21:03,443
OK!

1085
01:21:12,786 --> 01:21:13,995
Mitsuha?

1086
01:21:16,331 --> 01:21:18,041
Hey, Mitsuha?

1087
01:21:26,966 --> 01:21:28,843
I wanted to tell you.

1088
01:21:30,678 --> 01:21:33,097
Wherever you are in the world,

1089
01:21:33,098 --> 01:21:35,392
I'll search for you.

1090
01:21:39,104 --> 01:21:41,272
Your name is Mitsuha.

1091
01:21:43,149 --> 01:21:45,235
It's OK. I remember.

1092
01:21:45,610 --> 01:21:48,112
Mitsuha. Mitsuha. Mitsuha.

1093
01:21:48,113 --> 01:21:49,530
Your name is Mitsuha.

1094
01:21:49,531 --> 01:21:50,990
Your name is...

1095
01:22:01,584 --> 01:22:04,754
Who are you?

1096
01:22:07,006 --> 01:22:09,926
Why did I come here?

1097
01:22:10,760 --> 01:22:13,721
I came here to see her.

1098
01:22:14,097 --> 01:22:17,809
To save her. I wanted her to be alive.

1099
01:22:18,393 --> 01:22:20,436
Who was it? Who?

1100
01:22:20,437 --> 01:22:21,813
Who did I come to see?

1101
01:22:23,440 --> 01:22:25,691
Someone dear to me. I don't want to forget.

1102
01:22:25,692 --> 01:22:27,444
I shouldn't forget!

1103
01:22:28,736 --> 01:22:33,199
Who? Who? Who? Who?

1104
01:22:33,700 --> 01:22:35,285
What's your name?

1105
01:22:36,536 --> 01:22:44,209
Caught in a never-ending game. Seems
like the world's still trying to tame me

1106
01:22:44,210 --> 01:22:50,424
If that's the way I will obey.
Beautifully struggle everyday

1107
01:22:50,425 --> 01:22:53,844
Taki. Taki. Taki.

1108
01:22:53,845 --> 01:22:57,557
It's OK. I remember. I'll never forget!

1109
01:22:58,057 --> 01:23:00,059
Taki. Taki.

1110
01:23:00,518 --> 01:23:03,646
Your name is Taki!

1111
01:23:13,490 --> 01:23:15,909
"Itomori Substation"

1112
01:23:18,369 --> 01:23:19,329
Tessie!

1113
01:23:19,662 --> 01:23:22,373
Mitsuha! Where've you been?

1114
01:23:22,457 --> 01:23:24,667
He said sorry for breaking your bike.

1115
01:23:25,460 --> 01:23:27,545
- Huh? Who did?
- I did.

1116
01:23:28,630 --> 01:23:30,924
Explain everything to me later.

1117
01:23:35,303 --> 01:23:38,055
That's going to fall? Really?

1118
01:23:38,056 --> 01:23:40,433
Yes! Saw it with my own eyes!

1119
01:23:41,267 --> 01:23:42,769
What? You saw it, huh?

1120
01:23:42,977 --> 01:23:45,146
Then I guess we got no choice.

1121
01:23:45,813 --> 01:23:48,274
Now we're both criminals!

1122
01:23:49,317 --> 01:23:50,360
"Broadcasting Room"

1123
01:23:51,069 --> 01:23:53,028
What? I really have to do it?

1124
01:23:53,029 --> 01:23:56,950
When the town's power goes out,

1125
01:23:57,450 --> 01:23:59,202
the equipment there should work on backup.

1126
01:23:59,619 --> 01:24:00,953
Please, Sayaka!

1127
01:24:00,954 --> 01:24:02,871
Repeat it as much as you can!

1128
01:24:02,872 --> 01:24:05,583
Woo-hoo! You can do it!

1129
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,169
Oh, to heck with it!

1130
01:24:15,426 --> 01:24:16,718
Soon, you think?

1131
01:24:16,719 --> 01:24:18,054
I've no idea!

1132
01:24:28,439 --> 01:24:29,940
What was that?

1133
01:24:29,941 --> 01:24:31,484
Look over there

1134
01:24:32,819 --> 01:24:39,367
At an unprecedented speed
I will drive right into you

1135
01:24:40,076 --> 01:24:43,912
And when I dozed off into
a lukewarm can of soda

1136
01:24:43,913 --> 01:24:47,833
I dreamed of a world so far from here,
that's not on the map

1137
01:24:47,834 --> 01:24:51,379
Searching outside of the classroom window

1138
01:24:51,671 --> 01:24:57,135
or in summer morning that's
brought from the commuting train

1139
01:24:57,468 --> 01:24:59,095
Hey. look!

1140
01:25:08,563 --> 01:25:12,649
This is Itomori Town Hall.

1141
01:25:12,650 --> 01:25:15,527
An explosion has occurred
at the substation.

1142
01:25:15,528 --> 01:25:16,987
- An accident?
- An explosion?

1143
01:25:16,988 --> 01:25:21,450
There is danger of further explosions
and forest fires.

1144
01:25:21,451 --> 01:25:24,369
Residents in the following areas,

1145
01:25:24,370 --> 01:25:27,040
please evacuate to Itomori High School.

1146
01:25:28,082 --> 01:25:32,712
Kadoiri District, Sakagami District,

1147
01:25:33,129 --> 01:25:35,255
The broadcast isn't from here?

1148
01:25:35,256 --> 01:25:36,423
Who is it, then?

1149
01:25:36,424 --> 01:25:38,301
Miyamori District...

1150
01:25:39,260 --> 01:25:40,970
Oyazawa District...

1151
01:25:42,013 --> 01:25:43,890
Let's go, Mitsuha!

1152
01:25:44,807 --> 01:25:47,185
Tessie!

1153
01:25:53,191 --> 01:25:55,525
Run, everyone! Forest fire!

1154
01:25:55,526 --> 01:25:57,904
Forest fire! Please evacuate!

1155
01:25:58,446 --> 01:25:59,739
Run! Fire!

1156
01:25:59,822 --> 01:26:02,867
It's not safe here! Please evacuate!

1157
01:26:04,077 --> 01:26:06,871
We don't have enough time! Mitsuha!

1158
01:26:08,498 --> 01:26:09,666
What's wrong?

1159
01:26:10,416 --> 01:26:14,337
His name... I can't remember his name.

1160
01:26:17,173 --> 01:26:18,799
Look, I don't know.

1161
01:26:18,800 --> 01:26:20,468
You started all this!

1162
01:26:21,260 --> 01:26:23,888
We can't evacuate everyone by ourselves!

1163
01:26:24,305 --> 01:26:26,766
Go persuade your father!

1164
01:26:35,024 --> 01:26:38,319
Everyone run! Go to the high school!

1165
01:26:40,988 --> 01:26:42,740
Oh, Mitsuha.

1166
01:26:45,618 --> 01:26:47,786
It's no terrorist attack!

1167
01:26:47,787 --> 01:26:48,954
What's Chubu Electric saying?

1168
01:26:48,955 --> 01:26:50,206
They're still checking!

1169
01:26:50,581 --> 01:26:54,084
No forest fire yet? Are you sure?

1170
01:26:54,085 --> 01:26:55,086
OK!

1171
01:26:56,504 --> 01:26:58,171
Stop this broadcast!

1172
01:26:58,172 --> 01:27:00,174
Figure out where it's coming from!

1173
01:27:00,508 --> 01:27:03,302
The Takayama sensor station called!

1174
01:27:04,178 --> 01:27:05,555
The high school?

1175
01:27:06,013 --> 01:27:09,641
Again, residents in the following areas,

1176
01:27:09,642 --> 01:27:12,102
evacuate to Itomori High School... Oh!

1177
01:27:12,103 --> 01:27:14,814
What are you doing? Turn that off!

1178
01:27:16,858 --> 01:27:17,899
Sayaka!

1179
01:27:17,900 --> 01:27:19,318
Oh no.

1180
01:27:22,613 --> 01:27:25,533
What have you done, Sayaka!

1181
01:27:28,911 --> 01:27:31,789
This is Itomori Town Hall.

1182
01:27:32,999 --> 01:27:36,127
We are currently checking on the accident.

1183
01:27:37,003 --> 01:27:39,755
Please don't panic and stay

1184
01:27:39,756 --> 01:27:42,215
where you are for further notice.

1185
01:27:42,216 --> 01:27:44,009
Stay put, they said.

1186
01:27:44,010 --> 01:27:45,011
What's going on?

1187
01:27:45,094 --> 01:27:46,304
So we stay put?

1188
01:27:47,221 --> 01:27:49,557
Come on, you should all evacuate!

1189
01:27:50,266 --> 01:27:52,350
The high school is the shelter!

1190
01:27:52,351 --> 01:27:53,770
Katsuhiko!

1191
01:27:56,814 --> 01:27:59,317
What are you doing?

1192
01:28:02,570 --> 01:28:04,071
Sorry, Mitsuha.

1193
01:28:05,406 --> 01:28:06,657
It's over.

1194
01:28:09,076 --> 01:28:12,663
It's really splitting apart!

1195
01:28:19,378 --> 01:28:21,129
- Look at that!
- Wow!

1196
01:28:21,130 --> 01:28:24,257
Please look! The comet has split in two

1197
01:28:24,258 --> 01:28:26,092
and meteors are falling!

1198
01:28:26,093 --> 01:28:28,845
Nobody predicted this.

1199
01:28:28,846 --> 01:28:30,514
We have a mystical view here.

1200
01:28:30,515 --> 01:28:32,474
So the comet's nucleus split?

1201
01:28:32,475 --> 01:28:33,975
Did tidal forces affect...

1202
01:28:33,976 --> 01:28:36,019
The comet isn't within the Roche limit

1203
01:28:36,020 --> 01:28:38,814
so the nucleus itself must have...

1204
01:28:38,815 --> 01:28:41,525
In the past, Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9

1205
01:28:41,526 --> 01:28:44,361
broke and collided with Jupiter in 1994.

1206
01:28:44,362 --> 01:28:45,862
At least 21 fragments...

1207
01:28:45,863 --> 01:28:47,364
I have to go there look!

1208
01:28:47,365 --> 01:28:48,490
Is it dangerous?

1209
01:28:48,491 --> 01:28:52,202
They will probably melt
before reaching the ground

1210
01:28:52,203 --> 01:28:54,412
and the probability of a meteor crashing

1211
01:28:54,413 --> 01:28:56,540
into a residential area is small...

1212
01:28:56,541 --> 01:28:58,250
To predict the trajectory...

1213
01:28:58,251 --> 01:29:00,252
To be witnessing such a magnificent

1214
01:29:00,253 --> 01:29:01,753
celestial event, and...

1215
01:29:01,754 --> 01:29:04,631
That we're witnessing this live

1216
01:29:04,632 --> 01:29:06,883
is extremely fortunate

1217
01:29:06,884 --> 01:29:09,011
for those of us living in this age.

1218
01:29:11,514 --> 01:29:14,725
Hey. Who are you?

1219
01:29:18,729 --> 01:29:20,565
Who? Who?

1220
01:29:20,982 --> 01:29:22,400
Who is that?

1221
01:29:23,025 --> 01:29:25,986
Someone dear to me. I shouldn't forget.

1222
01:29:25,987 --> 01:29:27,780
I didn't want to forget!

1223
01:29:29,156 --> 01:29:33,202
Who? Who? Who are you?

1224
01:29:34,161 --> 01:29:35,788
What's your name?

1225
01:29:42,670 --> 01:29:44,005
It's broken!

1226
01:30:03,608 --> 01:30:06,985
So we don't forget when we wake up,

1227
01:30:06,986 --> 01:30:08,696
let's write our names on each other.

1228
01:30:17,121 --> 01:30:19,039
"I love you"

1229
01:30:19,040 --> 01:30:25,922
Even the way that you loved.
I swear I could smell the scent of yours.

1230
01:30:26,756 --> 01:30:33,721
And in the way that you walked.
I could hear that bright laughter of yours.

1231
01:30:35,640 --> 01:30:42,145
I can't remember your name with this...

1232
01:30:42,146 --> 01:30:46,066
Make sure that
it's burned into the back of my eyes.

1233
01:30:46,067 --> 01:30:53,490
It's not a right that I'm due,
my duty that is must have been kept.

1234
01:30:53,491 --> 01:30:54,825
Dad!

1235
01:30:56,661 --> 01:30:58,454
- Mitsuha!
- Mitsuha!

1236
01:30:58,788 --> 01:31:00,581
Not you again...

1237
01:31:04,752 --> 01:31:08,047
It was almost as if it
were a scene from a dream.

1238
01:31:08,464 --> 01:31:12,259
Nothing more, nothing less
than a beautiful view.

1239
01:31:12,718 --> 01:31:20,976
Words like 'tomorrow' or 'future or 'fate',
no matter how far they extend their hands.

1240
01:31:20,977 --> 01:31:28,692
We breathe, we dream, we raise our love, in
a timeless land that is far out of reach.

1241
01:31:28,693 --> 01:31:36,491
Even the second, hour hands of the clock, they
look at us sideways as they tick and took.

1242
01:31:36,492 --> 01:31:43,790
How I hope to have forever to spend.
This life, no - all future lives

1243
01:31:43,791 --> 01:31:50,923
right here in this world with you.

1244
01:32:44,143 --> 01:32:50,107
What am I doing here?

1245
01:33:00,117 --> 01:33:04,080
The next station is Yoyogi.

1246
01:33:16,258 --> 01:33:19,637
Please mind the door.

1247
01:33:22,473 --> 01:33:26,226
I'm always searching for something.

1248
01:33:26,227 --> 01:33:30,356
This feeling has possessed
me for some time.

1249
01:33:32,233 --> 01:33:34,192
I applied because...

1250
01:33:34,193 --> 01:33:35,777
The landscapes people live in...

1251
01:33:35,778 --> 01:33:37,821
To build a city's landscape...

1252
01:33:37,822 --> 01:33:39,405
You never know when Tokyo

1253
01:33:39,406 --> 01:33:40,907
might disappear as well.

1254
01:33:40,908 --> 01:33:43,701
So I want to help build landscapes that

1255
01:33:43,702 --> 01:33:48,082
leave heartwarming memories...

1256
01:33:50,209 --> 01:33:52,544
How many interviews have you had?

1257
01:33:52,545 --> 01:33:53,711
I haven't kept track.

1258
01:33:53,712 --> 01:33:56,214
- Can't see you landing a job.
- Thanks a lot!

1259
01:33:56,215 --> 01:33:57,966
Maybe it's because of that suit.

1260
01:33:57,967 --> 01:33:59,884
We're not that different!

1261
01:33:59,885 --> 01:34:01,177
I have 2 job offers.

1262
01:34:01,178 --> 01:34:02,388
I have 8.

1263
01:34:05,724 --> 01:34:07,809
"LINE: You have a new message."

1264
01:34:07,810 --> 01:34:13,190
I'm not sure if I'm

1265
01:34:13,816 --> 01:34:16,484
searching for a person or a place,

1266
01:34:16,485 --> 01:34:19,196
or if I'm just searching for a job.

1267
01:34:20,072 --> 01:34:22,448
Oh, you're job-hunting?

1268
01:34:22,449 --> 01:34:24,243
I haven't had much luck.

1269
01:34:25,452 --> 01:34:27,537
Maybe it's because of that suit.

1270
01:34:27,538 --> 01:34:29,498
Does it look that bad?

1271
01:34:34,044 --> 01:34:36,546
What brings you here today?

1272
01:34:36,547 --> 01:34:38,631
I came nearby for work

1273
01:34:38,632 --> 01:34:41,634
so I figured I'd say hi to you.

1274
01:34:41,635 --> 01:34:44,012
"8 years since the comet disaster"

1275
01:34:44,013 --> 01:34:48,099
We went to Itomori once, didn't we?

1276
01:34:48,100 --> 01:34:52,270
You were still in high school, so it was...

1277
01:34:52,271 --> 01:34:54,315
- 5 years ago.
- That long?

1278
01:34:54,857 --> 01:34:57,818
Seems like I've forgotten a lot.

1279
01:34:58,944 --> 01:35:03,574
I, too, no longer remember
much from back then.

1280
01:35:04,825 --> 01:35:06,492
Maybe we had a disagreement;

1281
01:35:06,493 --> 01:35:09,455
the other two returned to Tokyo without me.

1282
01:35:10,039 --> 01:35:13,125
I spent the night alone on some mountain.

1283
01:35:13,792 --> 01:35:15,544
That's about all I remember.

1284
01:35:18,005 --> 01:35:21,217
But at one point, I was inexplicably drawn

1285
01:35:21,467 --> 01:35:24,595
to the events surrounding that comet.

1286
01:35:26,931 --> 01:35:30,142
Half of a comet destroyed
a town in that disaster.

1287
01:35:31,143 --> 01:35:33,478
But most of the town's residents

1288
01:35:33,479 --> 01:35:34,521
were miraculously unhurt.

1289
01:35:34,647 --> 01:35:35,940
"Evacuation of residents
to high school grounds confirmed"

1290
01:35:36,148 --> 01:35:39,317
The entire town happened
to be holding an emergency drill

1291
01:35:39,318 --> 01:35:40,277
"An unprecedented natural disaster"

1292
01:35:40,278 --> 01:35:42,320
and most of its residents
were outside the blast zone.

1293
01:35:42,321 --> 01:35:43,781
"Residents safe"

1294
01:35:43,948 --> 01:35:44,907
"Disaster Foretold?"

1295
01:35:44,908 --> 01:35:46,866
The sheer luck and coincidence

1296
01:35:46,867 --> 01:35:48,576
sparked various rumors.

1297
01:35:48,577 --> 01:35:49,744
"Mayor Miyamizu's hidden agenda"

1298
01:35:49,745 --> 01:35:52,665
I intently read those articles back then.

1299
01:35:52,748 --> 01:35:54,083
"Mysterious explosion at the substation"

1300
01:35:55,125 --> 01:36:01,298
What had caught my interest so much
is now a mystery to me.

1301
01:36:02,633 --> 01:36:06,470
I didn't even know anybody in that town.

1302
01:36:08,013 --> 01:36:10,849
Thanks for today. This is far enough.

1303
01:36:12,142 --> 01:36:17,606
You will be happy someday too.

1304
01:36:21,068 --> 01:36:23,486
I feel like I'm always searching

1305
01:36:23,487 --> 01:36:26,490
for something, for someone.

1306
01:36:33,622 --> 01:36:35,791
"Construction company job interview"

1307
01:36:38,836 --> 01:36:41,963
I want to go to another bridal fair.

1308
01:36:41,964 --> 01:36:43,798
They're all the same.

1309
01:36:43,799 --> 01:36:45,717
Shinto-style is nice too.

1310
01:36:45,718 --> 01:36:47,928
You wanted a wedding in a chapel.

1311
01:36:48,762 --> 01:36:50,347
Oh, and Tessie.

1312
01:36:50,931 --> 01:36:52,849
Lose the beard before the wedding.

1313
01:36:52,850 --> 01:36:54,810
I'll lose 3 kg.

1314
01:36:55,311 --> 01:36:57,146
You're eating a cake.

1315
01:36:57,438 --> 01:36:59,440
I'll start tomorrow.

1316
01:37:01,150 --> 01:37:03,277
Thank you for coming.

1317
01:37:43,984 --> 01:37:45,234
"Itomori, the Town that Vanished"

1318
01:37:45,235 --> 01:37:47,738
"October 4, 2013-Itomori vanished."

1319
01:37:58,082 --> 01:38:00,501
Why does the scenery

1320
01:38:01,502 --> 01:38:06,048
of a town that no longer exists
wring my heart so much?

1321
01:39:25,669 --> 01:39:27,503
I was always searching...

1322
01:39:27,504 --> 01:39:28,964
searching...

1323
01:39:29,465 --> 01:39:31,216
for someone!

1324
01:40:28,815 --> 01:40:30,608
Hey!

1325
01:40:30,609 --> 01:40:33,570
Haven't we met?

1326
01:40:43,580 --> 01:40:45,415
I thought so too!

1327
01:40:49,920 --> 01:40:52,589
Your name is...
